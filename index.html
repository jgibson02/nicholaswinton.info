		<p id="introduction">Sir Nicholas Winton is a British humanitarian famous for his efforts in organizing the rescue of 669 Jewish refugee children from Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of World War II, and his incredible humility in keeping his efforts a secret. Here is
			his story:</p>
		<div id="img-container"><img id="winton-img" alt='Nicholas Winton standing with one of his "children."' src="https://www.ushmm.org/lcmedia/photo/lc/image/88/8893_1.jpg" align="right" /></div>
		<p>In December 1938, Nicholas Winton was a 29 year old stockbroker living in London. At the request of a friend, Winton joined him in his travels to Czechoslovakia as an ambassador for the British Committee for Refugees. Refugee efforts had been forming
			across regions throughout the Sudetenland after its annexation by Germany in September. Winton was further concerned for the treatment of Jewish refugees in the Sudetenland after the recent events of Krystallnacht in November.</p>
		<p>Winton began operating out of his Prague hotel to collect sign-ups from parents seeking a safe haven for their children, quickly attracting thousands of families per day. Soon thereafter, he returned to London to begin fundraising the necessary funds
			to transport the children from Czechoslovakia, and find homes that would take care of them. Winton succeeded in transporting Czechoslovakian children by train to Britain up until all rescue efforts ceased with the declaration of war between Great Britain
			and Germany following the invasion of Poland.</p>
		<p>After the war, Winton kept his efforts unknown until 1988 when his wife discovered a scrapbook in their attic, containing the pictures and names of the children he rescued. She shared the story of his involvement with Dr. Elisabeth Maxwell, a friend
			and Holocaust historian. His story was publicized in newspapers throughout Britain, which lead to his appearance on the BBC show <em>That's Life</em>. On the show, Nicholas Winton was introduced to the audience, and any members of the audience who
			owe their lives to Nicholas Winton were invited to stand. Over two dozen of the audience members sitting around Winton stood, introducing themselves as the children whom he saved over 40 years before.</p>
